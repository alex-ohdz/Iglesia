	  "content": "The Church of San Juan Bautista de Remedios, located in San Juan de los Remedios, Villa Clara, is considered to be the oldest church in Cuba. The current church was built in 1692 on the structure of a church that was originally built in 1570. The bell tower is of neoclassical design, and the interior is baroque. Some of the most important features are the ornate ceiling, the gold leaf, and the cedar altar, all carved in wood and laminated in gold by Rogelio Att√°, an artisan from Remedios of Asian descent, who also added baroque altarpieces and a pictorial collection in both naves of the church. Today, it is the only church in Cuba that is baroque both inside and out, and it is visited permanently by national and international tourists who come to appreciate its preserved heritage."
